**Cookie Clicker Mod Database**

Mods for *Cookie Clicker* can generally be divided into five main categories. Some mods may overlap, but they’ll be placed in the category that best represents their primary function. This database of mods is community driven if you notice something is missing please add it. This site seeks to maintain and track mods for the Web and Console versions of Cookie Clicker. Steam maintains its own internal tracking of mods through its Workshop, while many of these mods are also available on Steam not all of them will be. 

We take no responsibility for the content of these mods, nor does this site make claim of ownership of any, make sure to back up your save files!

### **1\. Content Mods**

These mods add new content without drastically changing the core gameplay. This includes new upgrades, achievements, buildings, or minigames that expand on the existing experience rather than redefine it.

### **2\. Gameplay Mods**

Gameplay mods significantly alter how *Cookie Clicker* plays, often transforming it into a fundamentally different experience. They may change mechanics, behaviors, game flow, or even the overall style and functionality.

### **3\. Appearance Mods**

These mods focus purely on visual changes. They modify the look and feel of the game—such as themes, sprites, or interface tweaks—without affecting the gameplay itself.

### **4\. Informative Mods**

Informative mods enhance the original game by adding tools that provide more detailed information. Examples include spell or golden cookie predictors, cost efficiency analyzers, and real-time timers for game features.

### **5\. Helper Mods**

Helper mods assist you with your tasks within Cookie Clicker such as auto-clickers, garden harvesters, stock market automation and things of that nature. While many of these mods automatically automate actions some may not.
